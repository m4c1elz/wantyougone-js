# wantyougone.js

Portal 2's credits song, in an actual command line interface.

## Requirements
- Node.js
- MPV

In order to make it work, just install the dependencies on the project's root folder:
```
npm install
```
Then run the index file:
```
node .
```
Sometimes, it may be out of sync due to having to use an external music player.
